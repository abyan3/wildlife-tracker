# Week 6 Class Demo

This is a small **React** frontend for Week 6 class demos. It has three pages—**Auth**, **Parks**, and **Sightings**

- **Auth** — Email/password sign-in and sign-up via [Supabase Auth](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth)
- **Parks** — Look up a park by id, lists all placeholder parks below.
- **Sightings** — Form that logs to the console, lists placeholder sightings below.

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Example placeholder data

These match `src/data/placeholders.ts` until you hook up a real API.

### Parks

A park is just a short id (the same id you type in the look-up box), a full name, and a state abbreviation.

Right now there is one park: Acadia National Park in Maine, id `ACAD`.

```ts
const parks = [{ ID: "ACAD", Name: "Acadia National Park", State: "ME" }];
```

To add another one—say Yellowstone in Wyoming with id `YELL`—add another entry to the list:

```ts
const parks = [
  { ID: "ACAD", Name: "Acadia National Park", State: "ME" },
  { ID: "YELL", Name: "Yellowstone National Park", State: "WY" },
];
```

On the Parks page, try id `ACAD` or `acad` (case does not matter) to see it match the first row.

### Sightings

A sighting is when and where something was seen: a date and time, which park (same kind of park id as above), and a species id your app or database uses. The number `id` is just a row id for React keys and later for a database.

There is one sample sighting: park `ACAD`, species `ACAD-1002`, on April 27, 2026 at 22:26:05 UTC (`+00` is UTC).

```ts
const sightings = [
  {
    id: 2,
    date_time: "2026-04-27 22:26:05+00",
    parkID: "ACAD",
    speciesID: "ACAD-1002",
  },
];
```

Another example would be a sighting at Yellowstone on New Year’s Day 2026, species `YELL-2001`, with a new row id `3`:

```ts
const sightings = [
  {
    id: 2,
    date_time: "2026-04-27 22:26:05+00",
    parkID: "ACAD",
    speciesID: "ACAD-1002",
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    date_time: "2026-01-01T12:00:00+00",
    parkID: "YELL",
    speciesID: "YELL-2001",
  },
];
```

Match whatever `date_time` format your backend expects; the sightings form logs values you can line up with this.

### Supabase (Auth)

The app reads your project URL and the public anon key from the environment so the browser can use Supabase Auth. Those are not secret like a database password; they still belong in `.env.local`, not in git.

Create `.env.local` in the project root. In the Supabase dashboard, open Project Settings → API and copy the project URL and anon/public key into the file:

```bash
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=sb_publishable_...   # or the legacy anon JWT
```

Restart `npm run dev` after you change env vars.

## Security

### 1. Cross site scripting (XSS)
The client side could be vulnerable to malicious scripts being returned. This is because input from the user can be used to display html to users. However since we use React malicious script code passed in would appear as plain text.

### 2. SQL injection
The client does not write to the database directly. This means even when submitting information for sightings that information is not interpreted as a SQL query. Values like notes and park id are treated as data not as code.

### 3. DDOS
The client side doesn’t use the server and only has static content. This means we don’t have to worry about servers getting an overwhelming amount of requests. If it was done on the client side, it would be up to the server side to limit the requests.

### 4. Authentication Failure
We don’t handle any of the authentication for the requests ourselves. However there is secure authentication with supabase’s handling of session tokens, passwords and more.

### 5. Broken Access Controls
Broken access controls are when users cannot act outside of their intended permissions. In sightings the user is getting a view of public information there is no private information needed to be hidden from the user. An approach to make sure that there can’t be any broken access controls is to not allow any access to the sightings form if not logged in.

## Development Guide

### Building a new image

Build a new image after the code has been updated, including giving it a tag and version

```bash
docker build -t wildlife-client:1.0 .
```

### Run the container

Run the container of the image

```bash
docker run -p 8080:80 wildlife-client:1.0
```

Use `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.

### Stop the container

Find the id then stop it
```bash
docker ps
docker stop <container-id>
```

### Delete a container

```bash
docker rm <container-id>
```

To also delete the image
```bash
docker rmi wildlife-client:1.0
```
